- On board when people come in: try not to sit alone!

- Start etherpad for class discussions / tracking what I’m typing

- Logistical notes
  - Student churn -- welcome to newcomers!
  - Compiler up
  - Intel Parallel Studio XE free for students
  - Submit HW0!

- I will start with the discussion of HW submissions so far + class
  background stats (and gently remind students to submit HW0)

- We’ll walk through an example of the logistics of setting up a PR
  for evaluation (with the lecture repository as an example)

  - Pre-step: get students who know how this works to do a show of hands
  - Aside: several students have been confused by the idea of PR without merge

- Class discussion: questions on reading?

 - Should have done Amdahl; in-class related question re: Gustafson
   (try to get students to submit via PR, small groups)
 - Open discussion: why not tune?  Back of the envelope re effort /
   time tradeoffs.  Note importance of high-impact practices (good
   compilers, test cases, etc)

- Cluster demo/discussion

 - Q: theoretical peak?  Open discussion
 - Basic framework: vector widths, issues per cycle, frequency — estimate
   - Ref: similar calc for Tianhe-2 nodes
 - Login to cluster and use hwloc to look at specs
 - Looking ahead: architecture discussion on Tuesday, reading/slides posted
